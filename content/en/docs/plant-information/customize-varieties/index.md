You can edit the information for any custom varieties you've added, but not existing varieties.<br />
Spacing can be customized for every variety, though. Set custom variety spacing to plan your garden with the proper spacing for each variety you grow.

To set custom variety spacing:
1. Select a plant, then select the **Varieties** tab<br />

2. Tap the **Pencil** icon next to **Spacing** (not the one beside the variety spacing)<br />

3. Drag the slider to increase or decrease the per-square-foot spacing for that variety, then select **Okay**<br />

{{< alert icon="🌶️" context="warning" text="Editing variety spacing will not update the spacing of existing plants in your garden- you will need to replace the plants." />}}

To edit a custom variety:

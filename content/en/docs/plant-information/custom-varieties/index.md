### Editing varieties
You can edit the varieties you've added, but not existing varieties. To do so:

1. On the varieties tab, expand the variety you'd like to edit.
2. Tap the pencil icon at the bottom (not the one next to spacing).
3. Adjust the information to your liking.
5. Tap "Save".

#### Editing variety spacing
You can customize the spacing of any variety. This way, you can plant one variety at a different
spacing than another.

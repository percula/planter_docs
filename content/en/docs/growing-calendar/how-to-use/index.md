Use the **Growing Calendar** in Planter to time your garden planting.

Check which plants you can **Start Inside**, **Transplant**, or **Sow Outside** at any point in your growing season.

1. Select **Calendar** from the menu bar<br />

3. Select the **Filter** icon to narrow the list of plants:<br />
- Select whether you want to **Show All** plants, see only your **Favorite plants** or see only the plants you have planned to plant **In Your Garden**<br />
- Select whether you want to see plants that you can **Start inside now**, **Transplant now**, or **Sow outside now** (select all three to see All of these actions, or leave all three unselected to the growing calendar for all plants regardless of whether you can plant them now)<br />

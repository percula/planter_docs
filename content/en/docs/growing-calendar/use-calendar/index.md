Use the **Growing Calendar** in Planter to time your garden planting.

Check which plants you can **Start Inside**, **Transplant**, or **Sow Outside** at any point in your growing season.

{{< alert icon="🌶️" context="warning" text="Be sure to *set your frost dates* so the Growing Calendar will show the correct timings for your area." />}}

1. Select **Calendar** from the menu bar

3. Select the **Filter** icon to narrow the list of plants:
- Select whether you want to **Show All** plants, see only your **Favorite plants** or see only the plants you have planned to plant **In Your Garden**
- Select whether you want to see plants that you can **Start inside now**, **Transplant now**, or **Sow outside now** (select all three to see All of these actions, or leave all three unselected to the growing calendar for all plants regardless of whether you can plant them now)

{{< alert icon="🍐" context="info" text="These filter settings work together- if you select **Favorite plants** and **Start Inside now**, you will see which of your favorite plants can be started inside now." />}}

4. Search to find the **Growing Calendar** for a specific plant

Use the Growing Calendar to time your garden plantings: check which plants you can start inside, transplant, or sow outside at any point in your growing season.

Be sure to *set your frost dates* so the Growing Calendar will work properly.

1. Select **Calendar** from the menu bar
2. Select the **Filter** icon to narrow the list of plants:
- Select whether you want to **Show All** plants, see only your **Favorite plants** or see only the plants you have planned to plant **In Your Garden**
- Select whether you want to see plants that you can **Start inside now**, **Transplant outside now**, or **Sow outside now** (select all three to see All of these actions, or leave all three unselected to the growing calendar for all plants regardless of whether you can plant them now)

These filters work together- if you select **Favorite plants** and **Start Inside now**, you will only see which of your favorite plants can be started inside now.

3. Select the **Sort** icon to change the sorting

4. Search t0 find the **Growing Calendar** for a specific plant

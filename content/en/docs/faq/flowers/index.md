Planter is focused on food gardening, so the only flowers currently listed in the app are either edible or good companions.

We're considering adding flowers to the app, although it'll be a major undertaking since there are so many flower species.

If you've got a few minutes to spare, we'd really appreciate it if you could fill out our [flower survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd03HjIP3Y43ARW6VIRi9aGVfpUK8kNMKtOIwKZL-OIXNCBgQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). Your thoughts will help guide our decision ðŸ™‚.

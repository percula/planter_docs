Planter is currently focused on food gardening, so the only flowers in the app are either edible or
good companions. However, we're considering adding flowers to the app, although it'll be a big process
since there are so many flower species. If you've got a few minutes to spare, we'd really appreciate
it if you could fill out this [flower survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd03HjIP3Y43ARW6VIRi9aGVfpUK8kNMKtOIwKZL-OIXNCBgQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). Your thoughts will really help guide our decision ðŸ™‚.

## I don't see zucchini or green onions? Where are they?
These are listed in the varieties tab of the plant. For example, jalapeÃ±o peppers are a variety of
peppers [here](https://planter.garden/plants/peppers?tab=1).

## Why doesn't Planter have {name of plant}?

Please use the [Plants and Feature Requests](https://planter.garden/requests) tool, which you can
find in [Settings](https://planter.garden/settings). If the plant you're looking for has already
been requested, please upvote it! This helps us prioritize which plants to add. While you're waiting
for it to be added, you can [add a custom plant or variety](../customization).


## What about flowers? ðŸŒ¼

Planter is currently focused on food gardening, so the only flowers in the app are either edible or
good companions. However, we're considering adding flowers to the app, although it'll be a big process
since there are so many flower species. If you've got a few minutes to spare, we'd really appreciate
it if you could fill out this [flower survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd03HjIP3Y43ARW6VIRi9aGVfpUK8kNMKtOIwKZL-OIXNCBgQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). Your thoughts will really help guide our decision ðŸ™‚.

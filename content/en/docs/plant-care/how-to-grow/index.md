- **Spacing:** how many plants fit within a square foot. The plant spacing per square foot can be customized by tapping on this card.

- **Depth:** how deep to plant the seeds. For plants that are not recommended to be grown from seed, the Depth card does not appear.

- **Sun:** whether the plant prefers a **Full Sun** location (6 or more hours of sunlight per day), a **Part Sun** location (4-6 hours of sunlight per day), a **Full-Part Sun** location (4 or more hours of sunlight per day) or a location in the **Shade** (less than 4 hours of sunlight per day).

- **Water:** how much water the plant needs in total per week. Some of this may come from rainfall, the rest should come from watering. If the plant does not typically need watering once it matures, the Water card will not appear.

- **Season:** whether the plant is a **Warm** season crop that grows best when daytime temperatures are above 70°F (21°C), a **Cool** season crop that stops producing when daytime temperatures reach 80°F (27°C), or a **Perennial** that comes back on its own each year, so long as it is hardy enough to withstand local winter conditions.

- **Frost:** whether the plant is **Tolerant** of hard frosts with air temperatures are below 28°F (-2°C), **Semi-Tolerant** of light frosts with air temperatures are between 28°F and 32°F (-2°C and 0°C), or **Not Tolerant** of frost where any frost might kill the plant.

- **Germination:** how many days or weeks it takes the seeds to germinate (sprout) under proper germination conditions.

- **Sprout to Harvest:** once the plant has sprouted, how many days it takes for the plant to start producing or to be ready for harvesting.

{{< alert icon="🍅" context="info" text="Tomatoes do not have Sprout to Harvest days noted, because it can vary dramatically depending on the variety!" />}}

#### Growing Calendar
Shows when to **Start Indoors** (start growing seeds indoors), when to **Transplant** (plant already-growing plants outdoors), and when to **Start Outdoors** (plant seeds directly outdoors), based on your frost date settings.

{{< alert icon="☀️" context="info" text="If you live in a region where the temperature does not go below freezing, you can ignore the planting dates in the Growing Calendar." />}}

- If the plant is typically grown by planting seeds directly outdoors, only the **Start Outdoors** dates will show.

- If the plant is typically grown by starting seeds indoors then transplanting outside, only the **Start Indoors** and **Transplant** dates will show.

#### Companion Plants
Plants that complement the selected plant when planted close by.

- Companion plants will not compete intensely for the same resources and do not suffer from the same diseases and pests.

- Companion plants can offer added benefits such as repelling pests and attracting beneficial insects.

Select the cards to learn more about each suggested companion plant.

#### Combative Plants
Plants that should not be planted beside the selected plant, as they can compete intensely for the same resources, or suffer from the same diseases and pests.

Select the cards to learn more about each combative plant.

{{< alert icon="🌱" context="info" text="Plants that are neither companions nor combative are neutral. It’s not a problem to plant them side-by-side so long as their basic needs are met." />}}

{{< alert icon="🌿" context="info" text="Some plants can be companions and combative, depending on the variety. An example of this is pole beans and bush beans. For these plants, Planter recommends only common companions and warns of all potentially combative plants. These plants have a yellow <a href=\"/garden\indicators#compability indicators\">compatibility indicator</a> in the garden." />}}

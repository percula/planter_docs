## Adding plants to the garden
1. Tap the "+ Add Plants" button
2. Find the plant you'd like to add in the list. You can search or filter the list.
3. Optionally, select the variety of the plant by tapping the drop-down icon (see Varieties documentation for more info)
4. Long-press on the plant to drag-and-drop it into your garden.
- The final location of the plant will be highlighted. If any existing plants overlap, they'll be highlighted in red and will be deleted if you drop the plant.
- If you change your mind and don't want to drop the plant, drag it onto the garbage icon
- Note: If the plant requires spacing larger than your garden, you won't be able to drag-and-drop it.

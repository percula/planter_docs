For temperate regions, knowing your frost date is vital to having a successful garden. Planter has a global database of weather stations to help determine your frost date.

### Automatically setting your frost dates
1. Go to Settings
2. Tap "Weather Station" and follow the prompts

### Manually setting your frost dates
1. Search on the internet for your frost dates
2. Tap "Spring frost date", then "Set Manually", and enter your spring frost date.
3. Tap "Fall frost date", then "Set Manually", and enter your fall frost date.

### Tropical and hot regions
If you live in a region where the temperature never goes below freezing, you can largely ignore the planting times given by the calendar. Plant cool season crops such as Broccoli and Cabbage in your cool season. Likewise, plant thirsty crops in your rainy season.

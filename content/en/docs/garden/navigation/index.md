## Quick plant mode

You can speed up planting with "quick plant mode":

1. Tap "Add Plants"
2. Make sure the quick plant switch is enabled <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-checkboxes-marked-circle-outline"></span>.
3. Drag and drop the first plant.
- If you correctly turned on quick plant mode, it will say "Tap to quick plant" in the bar above the garden after dragging the first plant.
4. Simply tap on squares to quickly plant subsequent plants.
5. When done tap the <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-close"></span> to stop planting or tap "Add Plants" to quick-plant another plant.

## Multi-select mode

When in multi-select mode (long press on any square or plant to enter multi-select mode), two icons appear:

![Multi select mode icons](multi_select_icons.png)

When the plant icon is selected, that means when you tap to select, you'll be selecting plants.
This really only matters for large plants, such as tomatoes; when a tomato is selected it'll
highlight all 4 squares. If the grid was selected, you'd select just single squares, regardless
of the plants that are there. The grid icon is best for changing backgrounds whereas the plant
icon is best for adding notes or deleting plants. When you're in either selection mode, the add
plant icon disappears because it currently isn't possible to add plants to all selected squares.

## Sharing garden screenshots

1. From the garden view, tap the â‹® icon and select "Share screenshot".
2. The system share dialog should pop up. From there, you can share it to any app or save it.

## Collaborating on a garden

1. Go to Settings in Planter and create a Planter account with email/password.
2. Send them those credentials so they can login and work on the same garden.

Helpful garden indicators in Planter let you plan and manage your garden at a glance:

#### Compatibility indicators
Compatibility indicators are the green, red, and yellow circles (and quarter-circles) that sometimes appear between plants in your garden.

- Green circles between plants means they are companions and work well planted next to each other.

- Red circles between plants means they are combative and shouldn't be planted next to each other.

- Yellow circles mean that some varieties of the plants are companions while others are combative.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ¥•" context="info" text="When you see a yellow circle, you may want to do some research to check whether the varieties you plan to plant are compatible." />}}

- No circle between plants means they are neutral - neither companions nor combative. They can be planted next to each other without issue, so long as their needs are met.

#### Plant Spacing indicators
Planter shows you many plants can be planted per-square-foot by showing a number with an x and a white circle around it.

- 4x means 4 plants can be planted within one square foot of garden space.

- Plants that need an entire square foot or more per plant do not have a spacing indicator. The size of the plant icon shows how many square feet the plant needs. For example, tomatoes need four square feet per plant.

{{< alert icon="ðŸŒ¿" context="info" text="If you change the units in Planter to metric, the plant spacings remain the same. Planter indicates how many plants can be planted in roughly 1/10m2." />}}

#### Notes and Events indicators

If you have added a note or an event to a plant in your garden, a Notes and Events indicator will appear on that plant.

- A plant that has multiple notes or events attached to it will show a layered Notes and Events indicator.

Notes and events for the entire garden can be seen by selecting the Notes and Events icon for the garden:

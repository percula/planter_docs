Helpful garden indicators in Planter let you plan and manage your garden at a glance:

#### Compatibility indicators
Compatibility indicators are the green, red, and yellow circles (and quarter-circles) that sometimes appear between plants in your garden. <br />

- **Green circles** between plants means they are companions and work well planted next to each other.

- **Red circles** between plants means they are combative and shouldn't be planted next to each other.

{{< alert icon="ðŸŒ±" context="info" text="Red circles have a darker inner circle to help color-blind gardeners identify them." />}}

- **Yellow circles** mean that some varieties of the plants are companions while others are combative.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ¥•" context="info" text="When you see a yellow circle, you may want to research whether the varieties you plan to plant are compatible." />}}

- **No circle** between plants means they are neutral - neither companions nor combative. They can be planted next to each other without issue, so long as their needs are met.

#### Plant Spacing indicators
Planter shows you many plants can be planted per-square-foot by showing a number with an x and a white circle around it. <br /><br />

- **4x** means 4 plants can be planted within one square foot of garden space.

- Plants that need an entire square foot or more per plant do not have a spacing indicator. The size of the plant image shows how many square feet the plant needs.

{{< alert icon="ðŸŒ¿" context="info" text="If you change the units in Planter to metric, the plant spacings remain the same. Planter indicates how many plants can be planted in roughly 1/10mÂ²." />}}

#### Notes and Events indicators
If you added a note or an event to a plant in your garden, a Notes and Events indicator will appear on that plant.<br /><br />

Notes and events for the entire garden can be seen by selecting the Notes and Events icon for the garden:<br /><br />

## Compatibility indicators

You may have noticed green and red circles between your plants. These are compatibility indicators, to help with companion planting.

Green circles mean the adjacent plants are companions and work well together.

Red circles mean the adjacent plants are combative and shouldn't be planted. These circles also have a darker inner circle to help color-blind gardeners identify them.

Yellow circles mean that some varieties of the plants are companions while others are combative.

## Spacing indicators

If you see a circle with 4Ã— in it, that indicates you can plant 4 plants in that square. Each square is one square foot (or 1/9 square meter). For more information, see [Plant Spacing](https://info.planter.garden/plants#spacing)

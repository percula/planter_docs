Made a mistake in your garden? No sweat!

You can undo (or redo) your **9 most recent actions** (including adding and removing plants, adding notes and events, and customizing backgrounds).

{{< alert icon="🌶️" context="warning" text="You won’t able to undo or redo your actions after leaving a garden or closing Planter." />}}

1. Use the Undo button to undo actions in sequential order

1. Use the Redo button to redo actions that have been undone

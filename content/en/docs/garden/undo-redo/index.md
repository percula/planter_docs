Made a mistake in your garden? No sweat!

You can undo (or redo) your **9 most recent actions** (including adding and removing plants, adding notes and events, and customizing backgrounds).

1. Use the **Undo** button to undo actions in sequential order

2. Use the **Redo** button to redo actions that have been undone

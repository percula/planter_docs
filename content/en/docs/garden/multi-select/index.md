Multi-select mode lets you edit multiple garden squares or plants at once. Multi-select is used to remove plants, add notes and events, or customize backgrounds.

1. Select the 'multi-select icon' <br />

{{< alert icon="🌱" context="info" text="Plant multi-select is more efficient for removing plants, as it will select the larger plants that take up multiple garden squares at once." />}}

3. Select additional garden squares or plants to be edited

4. Select an action for those squares (add notes and events, customize the background, or remove plants)

{{< alert icon="🥕" context="info" text="You can't multi-select garden squares to move them around or add plants. Use Quick Plant to add multiples of the same type of plant." />}}

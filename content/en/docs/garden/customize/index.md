To reset your garden background:

1. Select the square(s) to be changed
2. Select the palette icon
3. Choose a new background and foreground, or leave the background and foreground empty to clear all customizations
{{< alert icon="🌶️" context="warning" text="You can’t clear just the foreground or the background - clear all customizations first then select a new background or foreground." />}}

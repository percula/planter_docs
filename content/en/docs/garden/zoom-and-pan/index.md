## Interacting with your garden
- Use two fingers and pinch to zoom in or out
- When zoomed in, use a single finger to pan
- Tap on a plant to view it
- Long-press on a square and release to select it. This will bring you into multi-select mode, where you can select additional squares before selecting an action.
